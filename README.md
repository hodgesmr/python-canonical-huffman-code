# python-canonical-huffman-code

This implemented a [Canonical Huffman code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Huffman_code) file compressor and decompressor in Python. It has many inefficiencies. I implemented it as a learning exercise. I built it with Python 3.9, but it probably works with many earlier versions of Python 3. It has no requirements!

## Usage

```sh
# Compress
python huffman.py -i input_file -o output_file
```

```sh
# Decompress
python huffman.py -d -i input_file -o output_file
```
